        <p>A documentary filmmaker turned environmentalist switched to Environment Conservation full time in 2008 committing himself to it particularly in a pursuit to find a solution to the dwindling population of sparrows, living around human population. After multiple innovations and experimentations, he succeeded in creating a nest out of bamboo, cloth, jute, cotton among other things which have an adoption rate of over 85%. As a result of this, the population of sparrows which was on a steep decline in 2008 is currently at a comfortable figure. In addition to this, he has also been driving multiple innovative projects supported by different corporates and institutions particularly aimed at motivating the thought and action towards Conservational and Community Developmental Activities.
            Being the founder, he is the force behind the vision and programs of Eco Roots Foundation.</p>
